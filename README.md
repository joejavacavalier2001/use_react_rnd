This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you are checking out this project for the first time...
Before you can run the build or start scripts, you need to download the dependencies.
You can download them by typing:
### `npm i -f`


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

**When you build this project, you will need to add the public/Roger_test3_files files to wherever this is hosted.**

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**I don't use react-script anymore.
See the customized webpack configuration for more details.
The react-scripts from create-react-app added too many deprecated dependencies to manage!**
